# Example of Single-file Python CLI Apps

This is the example repository for my blog post on [Single-file Python CLI Apps](https://www.palmenhq.dev/annotated/2021/08/single-file-python-cli-apps/).

In short, it creates a single file from multiple files that can be executed with the Python interpreter. To see it in action, use;

```sh
./build.sh
bin/greet world
```
